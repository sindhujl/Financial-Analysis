# Financial-Analysis

**SCOPE:**

In this finance company's EDA project, the data analyst aims to identify patterns that predict the likelihood of loan default among customers. The company's key objective is to enhance decision-making in loan approval processes by recognizing factors influencing payment difficulties. By understanding customer and loan attributes through EDA, the company aims to minimize financial losses from defaults while ensuring capable applicants are not unfairly rejected.

**DATA AND FINDINGS:**

The exploratory data analysis involved a comprehensive cleaning and analysis process. In the application_data, columns with more than 50% empty values were removed, resulting in a refined dataset of 44 columns. Imputation strategies were employed for numerical columns using median values and for text columns using the most popular value. Outliers were identified using the IQR method, revealing anomalies in columns like AMT_ANNUITY and AMT_INCOME_TOTAL. Imbalance analysis indicated that 91% of clients faced no payment difficulties, while 8% experienced challenges. Further analysis in Power BI provided nuanced insights into customer demographics and their correlation with payment difficulties, aiding in the identification of low-risk customer profiles. The univariate and bivariate analyses highlighted significant patterns in age groups, housing types, income types, gender, and more, offering actionable insights for targeted decision-making. The correlation analysis brought attention to key relationships between variables, contributing to a holistic understanding of the dataset.
